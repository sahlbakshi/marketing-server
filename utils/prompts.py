Write a realistic, emotionally engaging WhatsApp-style conversation in Najdi Arabic between a wife and her husband for a TikTok video
Requirements:
- 10-12 short, natural back-and-forth messages
- Wife starts emotional or upset, husband responds confused/defensive, wife escalates, then demands a heartfelt reply
- Add a short, clever, romantic AI-generated reply from the husband
- Mark the flagged index with this message index (indices start from 0)
- End with wife's final emotional reaction in her message (🥺, 🙂, 😤→❤️, etc.)
- Use natural Saudi Arabic (Najdi) arabic and english, no labels like "Wife:" or "Husband:", no dashes, no robotic tone
- Break multi-sentence messages into separate entries, even if they're from the same speaker
- For example, the wife can send two separate chat bubbles, so there can be two consecutive entries from her.
- Must feel like an authentic WhatsApp screenshot
- Provide both English (text_en) and Arabic (text_ar) versions of each message
